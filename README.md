# ⏳ Chronos Time v1.0 — Public Disclosure (May 2025)

This repository contains the timestamped public release of **Chronos Time**, a universal, flow-aligned timekeeping system based on principles of relativity, quantum mechanics, and **Transcendent Flow Theory (TFT)**.

Developed by **James Neil Elliott III** between January and May 2025, Chronos Time defines time as an emergent function of gravitational curvature, quantum oscillation, and directional energy flow.

---

## 📄 Core Concepts

Chronos Time integrates:

- ✅ General and Special Relativity corrections  
- ✅ Quantum time units via Planck-based formulation  
- ✅ Energy-flow coupling (\( F_L \), \( F_D \)) from TFT  
- ✅ Dynamically adaptive time equations for universal synchronization

This system establishes **a new baseline for time across planetary, inertial, and non-inertial frames**.
